Utilizing a based code and changing some inputs and parameters, my partner and I were able to classify text using a variety of methods including several machine learning algorithms and text mining techniques including n-grams and regular expressions. 

The tweet code checked for sentiment analysis and classifed incoming tweets as either positive or negative based on the words used, ie. if a tweet contained the word hate, it would likely be negaive. 

The lyric project took in sing lyrics and tried to classify other lyrics by genre (hip-hop, rock, latin, etc.). For added bonus, we tried to classify what style of song different speeches would be. The famous "I Have a Dream" speech, given by Martin Luther King Jr. was classified as a Rock song based on the verbiage.

The logistic regression seemed to do best when classifying text (72%) with k-nearest-neighbors being only slightly better than a coin flip (59%).
