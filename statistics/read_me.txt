During my time as a graduate student, I took 4 different statistics courses. I studied courses on survival analysis (also called reliabilty analysis), bayesian statistical methods, statistical computing, and statistical data analysis. During each of these courses, while learning the theory behind advanced statistical methods, I focused on learning programming languages like SAS and R. I've worked through problems using descriptive statistics, like graphs and charts, and hypothesis testing using parametric, semi-parametric, and non-parametric techniques.
