This project is a analysis of a treatment vs. control group and the rate of survival of inoperable lung cancer patients. 

This report utilized SAS coding to run several t-tests and decide if the increased survival by the treatment was significant. 

It analyzed the data using both semi-parametric and non-parametric methods and came a conclusion (p-value = 0.3270 and 0.4616 respectively) that the treatment made no significant improvment on survival of the patients.
